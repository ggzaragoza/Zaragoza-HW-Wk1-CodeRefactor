# 01 HTML-CSS-Git: Code Refactor

In this repository you will find condensed and organized HTML and CSS files for the Horiseon marketing agency's main landing page.

Semantic tags and extensive indentation have been added for extra clarity, and alt and title attributes for all landing page images have also been specified within
the HTML document to better adhere to recommended accessibility guidelines.

Repetition of elements within the CSS style sheet has been minimized, while added comments provide brief descriptions of each element and its properties as they
relate to the main landing page.
